# Motivation

While trust in scientists is moderately high globally [@colognaTrustScientistsTheir2025], climate scientists have consistently been found to be less trusted than scientists from other fields and scientists in general [@druckmanContinuityChangeTrust2024; @ghasemiGapsPublicTrust2025; @schroderDontTellMe2023; @schugPublicPerceptionsTrustworthiness2024]. Lower trust in climate scientists could hamper societies’ ability to address climate change, resulting in high personal and societal costs.

Strengthening trust in climate scientists matters: Across 55 countries, trust in climate scientists was the strongest predictor of belief in climate change and support for climate policy [@todorovaMachineLearningIdentifies2025].

Increasing trust in climate scientists may therefore be an important lever to accelerate climate action and strengthen societal resilience to climate change. There is currently only a small number of behavioral intervention studies on increasing trust in climate scientists. The *Strengthening Trust in Climate Scientists Megastudy* aims to fill this gap.

# Survey process

![](images/survey_process.png)

# Outcome(s)

Our main outcome of interest is people's trust in climate scientists, along various dimensions (see @tbl-trust). All intervention proposals should only target this outcome variable. In addition, we will also measure several other variables which remain to be determined. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-trust
#| tbl-cap: "Multi-dimensional measure of trust in climate scientists. Answers are assessed with a slider from 0 to 100. Only the endpoints are labelled."


# Full table
trustworthiness_items <- tribble(
  ~Dimension, ~Item, ~Response_Options,
  
  # Introduction
  "", "We are interested in your general opinion about climate scientists. In answering the following questions, think about climate scientists specifically in the context of their work/research.", "",
  
  # Competence
  "Competence", "How incompetent or competent are most climate scientists?", 
    "0 = Very incompetent … 100 = Very competent",
  "Competence", "How unintelligent or intelligent are most climate scientists?", 
    "0 = Very unintelligent … 100 = Very intelligent",
  "Competence", "How unqualified or qualified are most climate scientists?", 
    "0 = Very unqualified … 100 = Very qualified",
  
  # Integrity
  "Integrity", "How dishonest or honest are most climate scientists?", 
    "0 = Very dishonest … 100 = Very honest",
  "Integrity", "How unethical or ethical are most climate scientists?", 
    "0 = Very unethical … 100 = Very ethical",
  "Integrity", "How insincere or sincere are most climate scientists?", 
    "0 = Very insincere … 100 = Very sincere",
  
  # Benevolence
  "Benevolence", "How unconcerned or concerned are most climate scientists about people’s wellbeing?", 
    "0 = Very unconcerned … 100 = Very concerned",
  "Benevolence", "How uneager or eager are most climate scientists to improve others’ lives?", 
    "0 = Very uneager … 100 = Very eager",
  "Benevolence", "How inconsiderate or considerate are most climate scientists of others’ interests?", 
    "0 = Very inconsiderate … 100 = Very considerate",
  
  # Openness
  "Openness", "How open, if at all, are most climate scientists to feedback?", 
    "0 = Not open … 100 = Very open",
  "Openness", "How unwilling or willing are most climate scientists to be transparent?", 
    "0 = Very unwilling … 100 = Very willing",
  "Openness", "How little or much attention do climate scientists pay to others' views?", 
    "0 = Very little attention … 100 = A great deal of attention"

# Interventions

For details on the interventions, please see the [Collaborate](call_for_collaborations.qmd) page.

# Participants

## Sample size

Once we have selected interventions, we will run a power simulation to be included in our preregistration.

## Recruitment

We will recruit a representative sample of the U.S. population based on several demographic variables.

# Open science

Following best open-science research practices, a detailed overview of data collection procedures, research questions, and analyses will be preregistered on the Open Science Framework.

Upon publication, all data, code, and materials will be publicly available.
