To believe in human made climate change—and the fact that it is a problem—people need to trust climate scientists: we typically cannot observe for ouselves how human actions affect the climate—we have have to rely on the measures, models, and interpretations of climate scientists. A large-scale study across 55 countries found that trust in climate scientists was the strongest predictor of belief in climate change and support for climate policies (Todorova et al., 2025). Strengthening trust in climate scientists may therefore be an important lever to accelerate climate action.\nThere is encouraging evidence on how to strengthen trust in scientists in general, but very few studies have targeted climate scientists in particular. For scientists in general, studies have found that using open-science practices (Rosman et al., 2022; J. Schneider et al., 2022; Song et al., 2022) and highlighting successful replications (Hendriks et al., 2020) can increase trust. One study found that presenting participants with an infographic about the scientific process slightly increased trust in scientists (Agley et al., 2021). Exercising intellectual humility—acknowledging the limits of one’s knowledge— has been shown to increase trust in a fictive virologist and a fictive climate scientists (Koetke et al., 2024). In another study, participants tended to acribe more expertise—a dimensions of trustworthiness—to scientists, when they present two-sided rather than one-sided arguments (Hendriks et al., 2023). One study found that reading short biographies of scientists made participants perceive the scientists as more trustworthy, presumably demonstrating benevolence (Hautea et al., 2024). Studies targeting trust climate scientists in particular are rare. One study found that messages emphasizing the need for changes in individual behavior or in public policy to address climate change reduced trust in climate scientists (Palm et al., 2020). Another study showed that participants perceived climate scientists as more skilled—a dimension of trustworthiness—after reading a text about the longstanding history and foundations of climate science (Orchinik et al., 2024).\nThe lack of direct evidence on how to strengthen trust in climate scientists is an issue: While trust in scientists is moderately high globally (Cologna et al., 2025), climate scientists have consistently been found to be less trusted than scientists in general (Ghasemi et al., 2025) and scientists from other disciplines (Druckman et al., 2024; Gligorić et al., 2024; Pfänder & Mercier, 2025; Schrøder, 2023; Schug et al., 2024). It is therefore not clear how findings regarding scientists more generally transfer to climate scientists specifically.\nAnother issue is the comparability of current findings: It is difficult to compare the effectiveness of different communication strategies on trust in scientists, because of differences in sample selection, outcome measures, and experimental design. This is all the more important, as not all studies have produced positive results. For example, a registered report testing messages tailored to conservatives in the US did not change trust (Gligorić et al., 2025). Another example is uncertainty communication: One study found no significant effect of uncertainty communication in science museums (Altenmüller et al., 2024), and some studies even suggest that communicating uncertainty might reduce trust in scientists (C. R. Schneider et al., 2022; van der Bles et al., 2020).\nHere, we aim to address these issues by systematically identifying, testing, and comparing different communication strategies to strengthen trust in climate scientists. To do so, we run a megastudy—“a massive field experiment in which many different treatments are tested synchronously in one large sample using a common, objectively measured outcome” (Milkman et al., 2021). Our megastudy comprises 20 text-based interventions issued from a crowdsourcing process. While trust in climate scientists is the main outcome, we will also assess the interventions’ impact on various other outcome variables, including, for instance, belief in climate change, support for climate policies and public research funding, and taking individual action to foster climate research (by making a donation a research institution). The results of our study therefore have the potential to inform the communication strategies of a wide range of actors—e.g., universities, research institutes, governments, or NGOs—looking to rally support in the fight against climate change.\nMethods\nThe interventions are the result from a crowdsourcing process: In an open call, we have invited researchers and practitioners to collaborate and submit proposals. we received 107 proposals. These proposals have been reviewed by our advisory board, consisting of experts on trust in science and behavioral interventions. We are currently in the process of making the final selection based on the reviewer scores.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nCologna, V., Mede, N.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, a large-scale study across 55 countries found that trust in climate scientists is the strongest predictor of belief in climate change and support for climate policies. Strengthening trust in climate scientists may therefore be an important lever for accelerating climate action. However, there is currently little evidence on how to strengthen trust in climate scientists.\nWe aim to address this gap by systematically identifying, testing, and comparing communication strategies designed to strengthen trust in climate scientists. To this end, we are conducting a megastudy—a large-scale field experiment in which many different interventions are tested simultaneously within a single, large sample using a common, objectively measured outcome.\nThe study will be conducted in the United States, where climate research is particularly threatened by funding cuts and public beliefs about climate change are highly polarized. Through an open call, we invited researchers and practitioners to collaborate and received 107 intervention proposals. From these, we selected 20 interventions, ranging from reading about climate science to discussing the topic with LLMs.\nWe will complete the preregistration in January and collect data from approximately 21,000 U.S. participants in February. By the time of the conference in Hohenheim at the end of June, a preprint will be available."
