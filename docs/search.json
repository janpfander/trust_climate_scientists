The process is fully anonymized — only the research lead (Jan) can link submissions to their authors, and cannot participate in the voting.\nFor full transparency, once the review process is complete, we’ll share all advisory board ratings and comments publicly (anonymizing both authors and reviewers).️\n🗓 We expect the review and selection process to be completed by mid-December. Stay tuned for updates!️\nTo end with a little fun fact: Since we received a couple of apologies for late submissions — don’t feel bad, you’re not alone, it really happens to (almost) all of us (Figure 1) 😅:\nFigure 1: Submissions by days until deadline.\nOnce again, a huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this collaborative effort.

    "text": "🤝 Collaborate with us!\nThe Strengthening Trust in Climate Scientists Megastudy is a collaborative research project to be run in the United States.\nWe invite researchers at any career stage—from students to principal investigators—as well as practitioners to submit intervention ideas.\nSuccessful contributors will receive co-authorship in the primary publication arising from this project.\nInterventions can be submitted by individuals or teams, with a maximum of two individuals per team. Each team may propose up to two interventions, which will be evaluated independently.\n\n\n🔍 What We’re Looking For\nWe are seeking short, text-based informational interventions that could increase trust in climate scientists.\nThe most promising interventions will be selected and tested in a megastudy—a large-scale online experiment designed for robust, replicable results.\n👉 Learn about submission rules and how to contribute on our Call for Collaborations page.\n📝 Submit your intervention proposal via our designated submission survey.\n\n🔗 More information\nFor more information about the project and the team, visit our website.\n💌 Questions?

    "text": "While trust in scientists is moderately high globally (Cologna et al. 2025), climate scientists have consistently been found to be less trusted than scientists from other fields and scientists in general (Druckman et al. 2024; Ghasemi et al. 2025; Schrøder 2023; Schug, Bilandzic, and Kinnebrock 2024). Lower trust in climate scientists could hamper societies’ ability to address climate change, resulting in high personal and societal costs.\nStrengthening trust in climate scientists matters: Across 55 countries, trust in climate scientists was the strongest predictor of belief in climate change and support for climate policy (Todorova et al. 2025).\nIncreasing trust in climate scientists may therefore be an important lever to accelerate climate action and strengthen societal resilience to climate change. There is currently only a small number of behavioral intervention studies on increasing trust in climate scientists. The Strengthening Trust in Climate Scientists Megastudy aims to fill this gap."
