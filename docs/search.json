    "text": "Climate change is one of the most pressing societal issues and requires urgent action at both the policymaking and individual level (Calvin et al. 2023; Rogelj et al. 2023).\nTrust in climate scientists is one of the strongest predictors of belief in climate change, support for climate policy, and climate action (Todorova et al. 2025; Cologna and Siegrist 2020; Hornsey et al. 2016).\nWhile trust in scientists is moderately high globally (Cologna et al. 2025), climate scientists have consistently been found to be less trusted than scientists from other fields and scientists in general (Druckman et al. 2024; Ghasemi et al. 2025; Schrøder 2023; Schug, Bilandzic, and Kinnebrock 2024). Lower trust in climate scientists could hamper societies’ ability to address climate change, resulting in high personal and societal costs.\nIncreasing trust in climate scientists may therefore be an important lever to accelerate climate action and strengthen societal resilience to climate change. There is currently only a small number of behavioral intervention studies on increasing trust in climate scientists. The STICS project aims to fill this gap."

Since the interventions will be tested across population segments, and the approximate size of the segments will be determined in WP1, we err on the conservative side and aim to collect a US sample of N = 10,000 and a Swiss sample of N = 10,000, for a total of N = 20,000 participants, with approximately N = 1,000 participants per condition per country.\nOnce we have selected interventions, we will run a final power simulation to be included in our preregistration."
