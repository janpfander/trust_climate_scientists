# Welcome!

The **Strengthening Trust in Climate Scientists Megastudy** is a collaborative research project to be run in the United States.

# 🤝 Collaborate with Us

We invite researchers at any career stage—from students to principal investigators—as well as practitioners to submit intervention ideas.

Successful contributors will receive **co-authorship** in the primary publication arising from this project.

Interventions can be submitted by individuals or teams, with a **maximum of two individuals** per team. Each team may propose **up to two interventions**, which will be evaluated independently.

# 🔍 What We’re Looking For

We are seeking **short, text-based informational interventions** that could increase trust in climate scientists.  
The most promising interventions will be selected and tested in a **megastudy**---a large-scale online experiment designed for robust, replicable results.

👉 Learn about submission rules and how to contribute on our [**Call for Collaborations page**](../../call_for_collaborations.qmd).

📝 Submit your intervention proposal via our [**designated submission survey**](https://stanforduniversity.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_afM7nQCU4wucFTg).
