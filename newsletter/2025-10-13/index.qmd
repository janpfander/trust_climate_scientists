# Welcome to the *Trust-In Megastudy*

The *Trust-In Megastudy* is a collaborative research project designed to strengthen people’s **trust in climate scientists** in the United States.


# 🤝 Collaborate with Us

We invite researchers at any career stage—from students to principal investigators—as well as practitioners to submit intervention ideas.

Successful contributors will receive **co-authorship** in the primary publication arising from this project.

# 🔍 What We’re Looking For

We are seeking **short, text-based informational interventions** that could increase trust in climate scientists.  
The most promising interventions will be selected and tested in a **megastudy**---a large-scale online experiment designed for robust, replicable results.

Learn about submission rules and how to contribute on our  
👉 [**Call for Collaborations page**](../../call_for_collaborations.qmd)
