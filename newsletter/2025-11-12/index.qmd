🌍🔬 Thank you all for submitting your fantastic intervention proposals to our Strengthening Trust in Climate Scientists Megastudy!

💪 You’ve exceeded even our most optimistic expectations --- we received `r n_distinct(submissions$code_name)` intervention proposals from `r n_distinct(submissions$responseid)` different research teams^[some "teams" are actually individual researchers---`r n_researchers_per_team$Alone$n_submissions` of the `r n_distinct(submissions$code_name)` submissions are single-authored] (`r n_interventions_per_team$two$n_research_teams` teams submitted two interventions), from `r n_distinct(submissions$institution)` different institutions. 

```{r}
# there are four researchers who are part of two teams
# submissions |> 
#   group_by(full_name) |> 
#   summarize(n = n_distinct(responseid)) |> 
#   filter(n>1)
```


💚 We’re especially proud that so many submissions came from early-career researchers who want to strengthen trust in science.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-career-stage
#| tbl-cap: Number of submissions by career stage of contributors. 

submissions |>
  group_by(position) |> 
  summarise(n_submissions = n_distinct(code_name)) |> 
  arrange(desc(n_submissions)) |> 
  tt()
```


🕵 Our advisory board will now begin reviewing all interventions. The process is fully anonymized --- only the research lead (Jan) can link submissions to their authors, and cannot participate in the voting.

For full transparency, once the review process is complete, we’ll share all advisory board ratings and comments publicly (anonymizing both authors and reviewers).️

🗓 We expect the review and selection process to be completed by mid-December. Stay tuned for updates!️

To end with a little fun fact: Since we received a couple of apologies for late submissions --- don't feel bad, you're not alone, it really happens to (almost) all of us (@fig-submissions-by-day) 😅:  

```{r}
#| label: fig-submissions-by-day
#| fig-cap: Submissions by days until deadline. 

# define key dates
deadline <- as.Date("2025-11-11") 
opening  <- as.Date(deadline - weeks(4))         


# compute days until deadline
submissions <- submissions |> 
  mutate(days_until_deadline = as.numeric(difftime(deadline, day, units = "days")))

# define palette
wes_cols <- wes_palette("Zissou1", 5, type = "discrete")
blue   <- wes_cols[1]  # distribution
yellow <- wes_cols[3]  # opening
red    <- wes_cols[5]  # deadline

# Create plot
submissions |> 
  count(days_until_deadline) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = days_until_deadline, y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = blue) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = red, linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(difftime(deadline, opening, units = "days")), 
             color = yellow, linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 60, label = "Deadline", color = red, hjust = 1.4, size = 3.5) +
  annotate("text", 
           x = as.numeric(difftime(deadline, opening, units = "days")), 
           y = 40, label = "Opening", color = yellow, hjust = -0.2, size = 3.5) +
  scale_x_reverse(breaks = seq(0, 28, by = 2)) +
  labs(
    x = "Days until deadline",
    y = "Number of submissions"
  ) +
  plot_theme
```

Once again, a huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this collaborative effort. Your expertise, creativity, and collaborative spirit make this project possible. 💫
