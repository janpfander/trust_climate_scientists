Lower trust in climate scientists could hamper societies’ ability to address climate change, resulting in high personal and societal costs.\n\nIncreasing trust in climate scientists may therefore be an important lever to accelerate climate action and strengthen societal resilience to climate change. There is currently only a small number of behavioral intervention studies on increasing trust in climate scientists. The STICS project aims to fill this gap.\n\n# Outcomes\n\nOur main outcome of interest is people's perception of climate scientists' trustworthiness, along various dimensions (see @tbl-trustworthiness). In addition to this, we will also measure several other variables which remain to be determined. All intervention proposals should only target the main outcome variable.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-trustworthiness .cell tbl-cap='Our measure of perceived trustworthiness of climate scientists will be an index of the items presented here.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 11px; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dimension </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Item </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Response Options </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> We are interested in your general opinion about climate scientists, including scientists working at universities, in government, at companies, and for non-profit organizations.
