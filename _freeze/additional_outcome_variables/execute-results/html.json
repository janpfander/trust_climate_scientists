The AGU was chosen because it is the leading scientific association for scientists working on climate change. Participants read following:\n\n\n> “For the next question, we would like you to have the opportunity to donate money to a non-profit or to keep it for yourself. Please decide how you would like to allocate \\$10 between yourself and the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The AGU is a non-profit, non-partisan scientific association. It is the largest scientific association in the area of climate change in the US, with over 15,000 scientist members. You can give all of the money to the AGU and keep none for yourself, or you can keep all the money for yourself and give none to AGU, or you can pick any split in between. Note: We will randomly select a subset of 100 participants and realize their choices. ”\n\n\\[Slider\\]\n\n\n## Scientists' role in policy making\n\nScale: from 0 to 100 (sliders)\n\nScales were adapted from the \"Normative perceptions of science and society\" scale in @colognaTrustScientistsTheir2025, but slightly modified: We removed two items, one because it was not strictly true (\"Climate scientists should remain independent from the policy-making process\") and the other because it was not policy related (\"Climate scientists should communicate their findings to the general public\"). We also use sliders instead of a 5-point likert scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 11px; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Item </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Response Options </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Climate scientists should work closely with politicians to integrate scientific results into policy-making </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Climate scientists should actively advocate for specific policies </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Climate scientists should communicate their findings to politicians </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Climate scientists should be more involved in the policy-making process </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0 = Strongly disagree … 100 = Strongly agree </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Reliance on scientists for lifestyle choices\n\nScale: from 0 to 100 (sliders)\n\nAdapted from the \"Willingness to be vulnerable to scientists\" scale in @colognaTrustScientistsTheir2025, but heavily modified. We retain only one item, as the other two (\"How much or little should governments rely on climate scientists’ guidance when making decisions related to climate science?\" and \"How much or little control do you want climate scientists to have on government decisions related to science?\") were conceptually closer to scientists' role in policy making. We also make changes to the one item we retain (original: \"How willing are you to rely on climate scientists’ advice when making lifestyle choices (e.g., sustainable transportation, energy use and nutrition)? (1) Not at all, (2) A little, (3) A moderate amount, (4) A lot, (5) A great deal\"), as the endpoints of the original likert scale might be asymmetric. Our modification also aligns better with our scale for measuring scientists' role in policy making. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 11px; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Item </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Response Options </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> When making lifestyle choices (e.g., sustainable transportation, energy use and nutrition), I am willing to rely on climate scientists’ advice. </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0 = not at all … 100 = Strongly agree </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Single item trust in climate scientists\n\nWe add a single item question on trust in climate scientists, to compare how this maps onto the different dimensions of our multi-dimension main outcome measure: \n\n\"How much do you trust climate scientists?\" (slider: 0 = not at all, 100 = very strongly)\n\n## Single item distrust in climate scientists\n\nAdding an item on distrust and comparing it to the trust item will allow us to test if they are symmetrical or not.\n\n\"How much do you distrust climate scientists?\" (slider: 0 = not at all, 100 = very strongly)\n\n## Support for climate policies\n\nAdapted from @colognaTrustScientistsTheir2025, who used a modified version from @vlasceanuAddressingClimateChange2024.
