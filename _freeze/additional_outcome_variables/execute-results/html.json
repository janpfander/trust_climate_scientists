The AGU was chosen because it is the leading scientific association for scientists working on climate change. Participants read following:\n\n> | \n>\n> “For the next question, we would like you to have the opportunity to donate money to a non-profit or to keep it for yourself. Please decide how you would like to allocate \\$10 between yourself and the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The AGU is a non-profit, non-partisan scientific association. It is the largest scientific association in the area of climate change in the US, with over 15,000 scientist members. You can give all of the money to the AGU and keep none for yourself, or you can keep all the money for yourself and give none to AGU, or you can pick any split in between. Note: We will randomly select a subset of 100 participants and realize their choices. ”\n\n\\[Slider\\]\n\n### Petition\n\n\\[*to be done*\\]\n\n## Normative perceptions & Willingness to be vulnerable\n\n\\[General consideration: normative perceptions, here, really are for the most part about scientists influence on public policy.
