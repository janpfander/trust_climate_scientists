The AGU was chosen because it is the leading scientific association for scientists working on climate change. Participants read following:\n\n> |\n  “For the next question, we would like you to have the opportunity to donate money to a non-profit or to keep it for yourself. Please decide how you would like to allocate $10 between yourself and the American Geophysical Union (AGU).\n  The AGU is a non-profit, non-partisan scientific association. It is the largest scientific association in the area of climate change in the US, with over 15,000 scientist members. \n  You can give all of the money to the AGU and keep none for yourself, or you can keep all the money for yourself and give none to AGU, or you can pick any split in between.\n  Note: We will randomly select a subset of 100 participants and realize their choices.\n  ”\n\n\\[Slider\\]\n\n### Petition\n\n\\[*to be done*\\]\n\n## Normative perceptions & Willingness to be vulnerable\n\n[General consideration: normative perceptions, here, really are for the most part about scientists influence on public policy. It would make sense to have a more meaningful, less abstract name.]\n\nScales were adapted from XX, but slightly modified. For example, for the normative perception measure, we removed one item (\"Climate scientists should be more involved in the policy-making process\") as it was extremely close to the first item of the scale. \n\nFor the willingness to be vulnerable measure, we retained only one item, as the other two (\"How much or little should governments rely on climate scientists’ guidance when making decisions related to climate science?\" and \"How much or little control do you want climate scientists to have on government decisions related to science?\") were very close conceptually to the normative perception measures. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Full table\nnormative_items <- tribble(\n  ~Item, ~Response_Options,\n  \n# Normative Perceptions of Science and Society\n  \"To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?\", \"\", \n  \"Climate scientists should work closely with politicians to integrate scientific results into policy-making\", \n    \"(1) Strongly disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) Agree, (5) Strongly agree\",\n  \"Climate scientists should actively advocate for specific policies\", \n    \"(1) Strongly disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) Agree, (5) Strongly agree\",\n  \"Climate scientists should communicate their findings to politicians\", \n    \"(1) Strongly disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) Agree, (5) Strongly agree\",\n  \"Climate scientists should be more involved in the policy-making process\", \n    \"(1) Strongly disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) Agree, (5) Strongly agree\",\n  \"Climate scientists should communicate their findings to the general public\", \n    \"(1) Strongly disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) Agree, (5) Strongly agree\",\n  \"Climate scientists should remain independent from the policy-making process\", \n    \"(1) Strongly disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) Agree, (5) Strongly agree\",\n  \n  # Willingness to be vulnerable to climate scientists\n  \"How willing are you to rely on climate scientists’ advice when making lifestyle choices (e.g., sustainable transportation, energy use and nutrition)?\", \n    \"(1) Not at all, (2) A little, (3) A moderate amount, (4) A lot, (5) A great deal\"\n) \n\n# Display the table\nnormative_items |>\n  kable(col.names = c(\"Item\", \"Response Options\"), escape = TRUE, longtable = TRUE) |>\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 11, position = \"center\") |>\n  pack_rows(\"Normative perceptions of climate scientists\", 1, 7) |>\n  pack_rows(\"Willingness to be vulnerable to the advice of climate scientists\", 8, 8)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"font-size: 11px; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Item </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Response Options </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr grouplength=\"7\"><td colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid;\"><strong>Normative perceptions of climate scientists</strong></td></tr>\n<tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;padding-left: 2em;\" indentlevel=\"1\"> To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?
