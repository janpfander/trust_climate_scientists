# Why should I participate in the project?[^1]

[^1]: This call for collaboration is inspired by other megastudies, in particular @voelkelMegastudyTesting252024

While trust in scientists is moderately high globally, climate scientists are less trusted than scientists in general [@ghasemiGapsPublicTrust2025] scientists of other disciplines [@gligoricHowSocialEvaluations2024].

Strengthening trust in climate scientists matters: Across 55 countries, trust in climate scientists was the strongest predictors of belief in climate change and support for climate policy [@todorovaMachineLearningIdentifies2025].

Given current attacks on climate science–particularly in the US–and the urgent need to address climate change, more research is needed on how to increase trust in climate scientists. Many people have ideas for how to address this problem. With the Trust-In Megastudy, we provide the opportunity to gather and rigorously test many of these ideas in a mega experiment.

Join our efforts to make a significant contribution to addressing this issue!

Teams whose intervention is selected for testing will be offered co-authorship on the primary publication resulting from the challenge.

# What is an intervention?

Social scientists often call an idea that has the potential to change how people think or behave an "intervention." In our project, an intervention is any idea that may influence the outcome variable we are interested in, namely trust in climate scientists.

# Who can collaborate?

This call is open to researchers at any level, as well as practitioners.

# How many collaborators per team?

Authorship will be limited to **two people** per submitted intervention.

# How many interventions per team?

Collaborators can only be in one team, and each team can make **only one** intervention proposal.

# Who are the participants?

All participants will be based in the US and over the age of 18. Our sample will be a non-probability online sample of Americans that is representative regarding several major demographic benchmarks. Due to filtering based on attention checks, participants can be expected to be relatively attentive to intervention materials.

# What are the requirements for my intervention?

Intervention proposals need to target trustworthiness of climate scientists (see details below) and be:

-   Text-based (e.g., no videos)
-   Theoretically motivated (rooted in the scientific literature)
-   Online (i.e. deployable in an online survey experiment)
-   Short (no longer than 5 minutes)
-   Costless: (i.e. not paying participants in addition to what they are already being paid to participate in the study)
-   Aligned (e.g., no additional measures for evaluating your intervention can be added)
-   Ethical (the intervention must be approved by Stanford's Institutional Review Board, see details below)

::: callout-tip
## Ethical requirements

Your intervention must provide accurate and true information without exposing participants to unnecessary risks or harm:

-   you may not deceive participants,
-   you may not ask participants to state false beliefs (e.g. ask them to rate all feeling thermometers at 100),
-   you may not present information to participants that is hateful, disturbing, or offensive,
-   you may not ask participants to engage in hateful or disturbing behaviors.

Further, your intervention must obtain ethics approval by Stanford’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). If your intervention is selected, our team will obtain IRB approval for your intervention. If the IRB requires changes to your intervention, we will work with you to make those changes while maintaining as much consistency as possible to your original idea. You are encouraged to contact us via [{{< var email >}}](mailto:{{< var email >}}) if you have concerns about ethics approval. We will not select interventions that attempt to game the system in some way, e.g., by instructing participants on how to reply to the DVs.

# What are the outcomes?

The outcome of interest that interventions should target are perceptions of climate scientists' trustworthiness (see the [research design section](research_design.qmd) for more details).

# Can I Submit Different Interventions for Different Participants?

It is acceptable for an intervention to vary based on participant features (e.g., their partisanship, gender, race). For example, an “ingroup source” intervention can use a pro-Democrat source for informing Democrat participants, and a pro-Republican source for informing Republican participants. In this case, the intervention would have the exact same instructions for all participants, but the "ingroup" varies as a function of each participants' partisan affiliation. If you have questions whether your intervention satisfies these criteria, you are welcome to [email us]((mailto:{{< var email >}})) about the suitability of your intervention before you submit it.

# How will you select the interventions?

Our expert team, composed of the research team and an advisory board, will review submissions and select the most promising interventions for testing. Members of the advisory board are experts on trust in science and behavioral science from diverse backgrounds, including academics from different disciplines as well as practitioners.

We aim to test up to 10 interventions, with a well-powered sample (\~1000 participants per condition).

The selection process is **anonymous**: Only the Project Lead, Jan, knows about the identity of the contributors and will not be involved in the selection process.

The expert team will review interventions to check whether they satisfy the requirements for interventions. They will then select the most promising ones. We will notify you if your intervention does not satisfy the requirements and work with you, within reason, to revise the intervention so that it is eligible. You are welcome to contact us with questions about your intervention before you submit.
