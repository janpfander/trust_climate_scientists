# Why should I participate in the STICS project?

There is increasing concern that people do not trust scientists, and especially climate scientists. This can have profound implications by limiting support for evidence-based policymaking and reducing societal resilience to climate change. Many people have ideas for how to address this problem. Now is an opportunity to gather and rigorously test many of these ideas. We needed your expertise and the rigor of massive experimentation to address this issue.

Teams whose intervention is selected for testing will be offered co-authorship on the primary publication resulting from the challenge.

# What is an intervention? 

Social scientists often call an idea that has the potential to change how people think or behave an "intervention." In the case of the STICS project, an intervention is any idea that may influence the outcome variables we are interested in. 

# What are the outcomes?

Our main outcome of interest is people's perception of climate scientists' trustworthiness. Check-out the research design section [research design section](research_design.qmd) for more details on the outcomes and how we measure them. 

# What are the Requirements for My Intervention?

- Ethical: The intervention must be approved by Stanford's and the ETH Zurich's Institutional Review Board (see details below).
- Online: The intervention must be deployable online.
- Short: The intervention must be no longer than 8 minutes.
- Scalable: The intervention must be able to be tested with around 1,000 participants at the same time.
- Costless: The intervention must not pay participants in addition to what they are
already being paid to participate in the study.
- Aligned: You cannot add additional measures for evaluating your intervention

## Ethical requirements

Your intervention must provide accurate and true information without exposing participants
to unnecessary risks or harm:

- you may not deceive participants,
- you may not ask participants to state false beliefs (e.g. ask them to rate all feeling
thermometers at 100),
- you may not present information to participants that is hateful, disturbing, or
offensive,
- you may not ask participants to engage in hateful or disturbing behaviors.

Further, your intervention must obtain ethics approval by by Stanford’s and the ETH Zurich’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). If your intervention is selected, our team will obtain IRB approval for your intervention. If the IRB requires changes to your intervention, we will work with you to make those changes while maintaining as much consistency as possible to your original idea. You are encouraged to contact us via [stics.megastudy@gmail.com](mailto:stics.megastudy@gmail.com) if you have concerns about ethics approval. We will not select interventions that attempt to game the system in some way, e.g., by instructing participants on how to reply to the DVs.

# How will you select the interventions?

Our expert team will review submissions and select the 9 most promising interventions for testing. Members of the advisory board are experts on trust in science from diverse backgrounds, including academics from different disciplines as well as practitioners. 

The selection process is **anonymous**: Only the Project lead--who will neither review pre-selected interventions, nor vote during the final selection--knows about the identity of the contributors.

The selection process has two stages: First, all contributors submit a very short description of their study. We will then pre-select interventions that we deem feasible and promising. Second, pre-selected contributors submit a detailed intervention design. The expert team will review these interventions to check whether they satisfy the requirements for interventions. We will notify you if your intervention does not satisfy the requirements and work with you, within reason, to revise the intervention so that it is eligible. You are welcome to contact us with questions about your intervention before you submit. 

Each intervention will be reviewed by at least 4 experts. Reviews will be based on the following criteria:

- What is the expected success of this intervention?
- How novel is this intervention? 

In a plenary meeting, the whole expert team will then vote on the final interventions based on the reviews. 

# How can I participate?
